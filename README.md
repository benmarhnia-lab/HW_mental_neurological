## Study Question

How do daytime and nighttime heatwave intensities differentially affect hospitalizations risk for multiple subtypes of mental and neurological disorders in California, where daytime heatwaves are typically dry and nighttime heatwaves are typically humid?

## R Version

This analysis was conducted using **R version 4.3.1**.  
Key R packages used include:

- `dplyr`
- `lubridate`
- `gnm`

## Data Sources

The study uses the following data sources:

- All meteorological data used in this study are publicly available at the website of Gridded Meteorological reanalysis product (https://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html/).
- The hospitalization data can be requested from the California Department of Health Care Access and Information (https://hcai.ca.gov/).
